# World Cup Database

I followed the database schema and step-by-step instructions provided by freeCodeCamp.  
There was little room for creativity, since the goal was to practice SQL queries, Bash scripting, and database manipulation.

## Files
- **worldcup.sql** – Database schema and table definitions  
- **insert_data.sh** – Bash script to populate the database from `games.csv`  
- **queries.sh** – Script with the required SQL queries to retrieve data  

## Tech Stack
- PostgreSQL  
- Bash
